## Weather-Report

A weather web application using API (Open weather map API). You type in the name of the city and get the current temperature, wind speed & pressure for that city

# Features
* Search by city name
* Show current weather
* Also show wind speed & pressure level

# To make this application, I used several tools or scripting language:
* HTML - the information represented on the page
* CSS - the style or look of the information
* JavaScript - the scripting language needed to add the necessary behavior (or interaction) to the webpage
* API (Application Programming Interface) - where & how we get the weather data (https://openweathermap.org/api)
* jQuery - a javascript library that makes web programming a bit easier for us
